Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.
The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.
Your limitation—it's only your imagination.
